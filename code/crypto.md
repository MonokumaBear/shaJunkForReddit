#Crypto
right now i dont have a well defined structure
you will find evironment variables in prefetch.py
you will find all methods and functions in libs.py

I will add a documentation and automated scripts later

#inb4 duplicate files:
i need those files te load into my scripts, DONT remove them.
I certainly wont change the path as it will be too much of a hassle.

#Documentation

## libs.py
Loads necessary libs for Polybius Square nihilist cyphers and more...
## prefetch.py
loads environment vars and libraries
## order.py 
loads files... will be integrated into prefetch or order

# Detailed Docu
## libs.py
### class Polybius
Class representing a polybiues square
loads a 5x5 polybius square with the standard english alphabet with i/j.
#### constructor
##### Polybius(order=\<str\>, dims =\<int\>)
##### order is your alphabet
##### dims is the desired length of your polybius square... Polybius rectangle not yet implemented, but i guess you could simply zero pad
